## CUAV SX RADIO Over View Data Transfer Module

## summary {#sumary}

---

CUAV SX Radio is a high-power, high-speed, high-reception sensitivity data transmission module

It has a built-in SDI RF module from DIGI, USA, with a transmit power of 1000mw and an ISM 900MHZ legal frequency, supporting a variety of advanced network options and topology modes.

The CUAV SX Radio module offers an unprecedented range of low-cost wireless data solutions. This module is easy to use, especially suitable for unmanned unit networks and point-to-point over-the-horizon transmission, providing stable, critical data transmission between drones and equipment. Their small size saves valuable on-board space.
